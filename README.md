🚀 Just Completed My Power BI Project – Business Insights 360 (BI_360) 📊

Thrilled to share my latest end-to-end Power BI dashboard — Business Insights 360 (BI_360) — designed to provide a 360° view of business performance through five strategic perspectives:

🔍 Project Highlights:

🔷 Sales View – Dynamic matrix with DAX-powered filters by product/customer

🔷 Marketing View – Market-wise performance across regions

🔷 Supply Chain View – Forecast accuracy %, net/absolute error analytics

🔷 Executive View – Strategic KPI snapshot for leadership decision-making

🛠 Tech Stack Used:

🔷 SQL | Excel | Power BI Desktop | DAX | DAX Studio

🔷 Power BI Service | Personal Gateway

🔷 Project Charter Document for planning & scope

🎯 Key Power BI Techniques I Learned:

🔹 Data modeling & creating a custom date table using M language

🔹 Creating calculated columns and DAX measures

🔹 Bookmarks & buttons for toggling visuals

Page navigation

🔹 Conditional formatting & KPI indicators

🔹 Dynamic titles based on filter context
